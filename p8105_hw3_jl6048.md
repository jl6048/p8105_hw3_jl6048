## Problem 1

**How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?**

-   There are 134 aisles in this data set and the most items are ordered
    from the fresh vegetables and fresh fruits aisles.

``` r
data("instacart")
instacart_df =
  instacart %>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
instacart_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ... with 124 more rows

**Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered**

``` r
instacart_df %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>%
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(
    title = "The number of items ordered in each aisle",
    x = "aisle name",
    y = "order numbers",
    caption = "Data from the instacart") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

**Make a table showing the three most popular items**

``` r
popitems_df = 
  instacart %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
    group_by(aisle) %>% 
    count(product_name) %>% 
    mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>%
    filter(rank < 4) %>% 
    arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
    knitr::kable()
popitems_df
```

**Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;**

``` r
meanhour_df =
  instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples","Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour) %>% 
  rename(
    sun. = "0", mon. = "1", tue. = "2", 
    wed. = "3", thu. = "4", fri. = "5", sat. = "6") %>% 
  knitr::kable()
 meanhour_df 
```

| product\_name    |     sun. |     mon. |     tue. |     wed. |     thu. |     fri. |     sat. |
|:-----------------|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77419 | 14.31579 | 15.38095 | 15.31818 | 15.21739 | 12.26316 | 13.83333 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44118 | 11.36000 | 11.70213 | 14.25000 | 11.55172 | 12.78431 | 11.93750 |

**Description**: This datasets has 1384617 observations and 15
variables.

The key variables are as follows: \* `product_name`: name of the product
\* `aisle`: name of the aisle \* `order_dow`: the day of the week on
which the order was placed \* `order_hour_of_day`: the hour of the day
